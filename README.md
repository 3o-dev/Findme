An **ARKit** App that can do three things:

- Recording the route you've passed by
- Sharing the route with your friends
- Your friends can find the start position of the route, then follow it to find you

## Improving

**ARKit** is not so stable now, so we've tried some methods to improve the accuracy of the route, mainly at these two branches:

- [Improving according to location](https://github.com/mmoaay/Findme/tree/feature/location_optimize)
- [Improving according to distance](https://github.com/mmoaay/Findme/tree/feature/distance_optimize)
